// AWS Account Id should be considered as a secret information.
// In this example, it stores on your local computer locally and the
// .gitignore file prevent you from accidentally checking in to Git.
// A better practice is to use AWS Service like Parameter Store or
// Secret Manager to store it. And update the ``jenkins_playground/devops/config.py``
// script to read from it.
